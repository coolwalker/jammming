This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
To run this project, you will need to register an app with Spotify and add the client id to util/Spotify.js. 
If running locally, change the redirect url in Spotify.js to localhost:3000 or whatever port you're running on. This also needs to reflect in your app settings in Spotify dashboard.


For details on creating react apps, refer to this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
